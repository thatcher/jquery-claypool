            <strong>app/configs/logging.js</strong> is the primary channel into 
            jquery.claypool.js as a debugging tool for your application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Claypool acknowledges that the diverse runtime environments an 
            application must run in are difficult to quickly and easily peer 
            into as the application flows through complex channels. Category 
            logging is much faster and much more environment agnostic when 
            monitoring your application for bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Logging in jquery.claypool is the most efficient implementation 
            possible. When logging is turned up, you will notice a performace 
            hit, but when its disabled there is almost zero impact on 
            performace allowing you to leave logging in place for the entire 
            life cycle of the application.

            There are three primary options available for this plugin,
            though generally only two are used.level, along with category 
            is the minimum required 
            information you need to turn on/off, up/down loggers so 
            you can quickly and easily debug you application without 
            the performance hit when you don't need it.

                        category

                    A dot delimited string name.  Categories are hierarchical
                    when not configured.  So if the logger A.B.C is not configured
                    specifically, it will look in order for A.B, A, then finally root
                    to detemine it's configuration.

                    </a><br/>
                    Level is either DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or NONE.

                        appender
                    </a><br/>
                    the appender pattern allows you log in a browser or in 
                    Rhino, or over the network, or to a cookie, etc. By default 
                    the logging appenders will detect with you are in a browser 
                    or in Rhino and append messages appropriately. 
                </li>
            </ol>
            The links above are given in order of general use. Most apps can get 
            started with only a simple level configuration, eventually they 
            might need to write log messages to cookies or a server so the 
            appender pattern provides . Finally you may find you need a very 
            special case where information is serialized in a special way so 
            you'll want to create some custom formatter logic.

            Usually all logging configuration is isolated in the single location
            at <strong>configs/logging.js</strong> and has it's own closure.  
            Here is an example that can help get you started, just replace 'Example'
            with your applications own top level object literal.
