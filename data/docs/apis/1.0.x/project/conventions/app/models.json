    <h3> Models </h3>
    <p>
        Models are just regular ajax routines (maybe...)! jquery-claypool provides 
        some guide lines as to how organize the 
        calls to provide consistent callback routines so asynchronous usage can 
        keep the controller in control.  But thats really all, like our stance
        on View technology, we are Model agnostic, you can use your prefered 
        technology.
    </p>
    <p>
        jQuery provides everything you need to use ajax to build a Model.  You can
        use you prefered server-side technology, or you can even use jquery-claypool
        on the server-side. jquery-claypool now has a <a href='../../../plugins/user/model'>
        $.model </a> plugin to allow you to cleanly describe, validate, and serialize
        your model for ajax on the client and json storage on the cloud.
    </p>
    
    <h4> Models Are Data Access Objects </h4>
    <p>
        It's usually via AJAX, AJAH, or AJAJ (x=xml, h=html, j=json(p)).  
        They might use caching strategies, like simple in-memory caching, 
        cookies, or even client-side storage from html 5 or google gears sqlite.  
    </p>
    
    <h4> Models Are Smart or Models Are Dumb </h4>
    <p>
        It's pretty much up to you.  In frameworks like Django, Models actually 
        are very smart, they know how to validate business concerns, cache and 
        do fancy tricks.  They can be dumb too though, and the smarts can be 
        implemented in the controller.  The decision is yours, and we delegate 
        to you.
    </p>

    <h3> Use a callback </h3>
    <p>
        The simple idea is that regardless of where we get the data, we provide 
        a consistent place to provide a callback so the controller can act as a 
        closure for the model response.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most common patters are function(args, callback), or my personal
        favorite is to use jQuery's ajax pattern function(options) where the
        options include both an error and success function.

<h4> Building a Callback Able Model </h4>
<p>
    Let's start by creating a simple closure that will define our model.
</p>

<pre class='box'>
/*
 * @file app/models/hello.js
 * @description You can feel free to use your 
 *     own writing style, we are providing an
 *     example not a rigid requirement of how to
 *     you have to write data access objects.  If you 
 *     want to take advantage of the mvc scanners
 *     (and keep the global scope clean) you should
 *     use a closure and single top-level namespace.
 *     In this example we use 'MyApp'
 */
(function($, $M)&amp;#x7B;
    
    var cache;
    
    $M.Hello = function(options)&amp;#x7B;
        cache = &amp;#x7B;&#x7D;;
        $.extend(true, this, options);
    &#x7D;;

    $.extend($M.Hello.prototype, &amp;#x7B;
        get: function(id, callback)&amp;#x7B;
           //model retrieval and callback logic here
        &#x7D;
    &#x7D;);
    
&#x7D;)(jQuery, MyApp.Models);
</pre>


<p>
    This is a good lazy model because it doesn't actively do anything when 
    the anonymous closure is executed other than define itself.
</p>

<h4> A Presumptuous Model </h4>
<p>
    Lets start using this mvc thing a little but keep it real simple.
</p>
<pre class='box'>
get: function(id, callback)&amp;#x7B;
    if(callback &amp;&amp; $.isFunction(callback))&amp;#x7B;
        callback(&amp;#x7B;
            animal:'this is a pig'
        &#x7D;);
    &#x7D;
&#x7D;
</pre>
<p>
    Wow! That was amazing!  But very presumptuous, because I would have 
    wanted to hear a cow...  
</p>

<h4> A Thoughtful Model </h4>
<p>Lets dive in.</p>
<pre class='box'>
get: function(id, callback)&amp;#x7B;
    if(cache[id])&amp;#x7B;
       callback(cache[id]);
    &#x7D;else &amp;#x7B;
        $.ajax(&amp;#x7B;
           type:'GET',
           dataType:'json',
           url: id,
           success:function(animal)&amp;#x7B;
               cache[id]=animal;
               callback(animal);
           &#x7D;,
           error: function(xhr, status, e)&amp;#x7B;
               callback(&amp;#x7B;
                   animal:'failed to load animal: '+id
               &#x7D;);
           &#x7D;
        &#x7D;)
    &#x7D;
&#x7D;
</pre>
    </>
